# HTML Forms
The [HTML `form` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form) represents a section of interactive controls for submitting information.

There are many different types of information you may want to collect from users, text-based answers, numbers, files, checkboxes, date, email, etc. It is important to specify the type of information you are collecting to make it easier for the computer to parse or translate the information and determine next actions.
