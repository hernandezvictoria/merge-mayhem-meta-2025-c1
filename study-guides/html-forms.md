# HTML Forms
To collect all of this information, we use the `input` element and specify the type of information by using the `type` attribute.

Let’s take a look at a few examples of how the `input` element is used for a variety of types of information.

- `<input type=”text”>`: The type `text` is used to take in a single-line text field. The `placeholder` attribute allows us to provide default text to display in the text field when empty.
- `<input type=”button”>`: The type `button` is used to create a clickable rectangular button. Alternatively, most developers use the `<button>` element instead.
- `<input type=”checkbox”>`: The type `checkbox` creates default boxes that are checked (ticked) when selected.
